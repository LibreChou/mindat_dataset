<div class="photocomments">26x 16x 5 cm. (that\'s about 10 3/4 inches at its widest point!) A large, LARGE plate of albite and aquamarines, and some muscovites too. The largest muscovite book is approximately 1.7 cm. and the largest albite, standing straight out of the specimen, is 3.5x 2.7x 1.2 cm, and there are about a hundred more smaller ones as well. Near the top edge of the specimen there are quite a few quartz crystals. This piece really illustrates the classic Pakistani aqua plate.<br/><br/>This photo has been shown 502 times<table class="picshowextradata"><tr><th>Dimensions:</th><td>640x480px (0.31 megapixels)</td></tr><tr><th>Date/Time of Photo:</th><td>10th Mar 2003 11:19:41</td></tr><tr><th>Camera:</th><td><a href="/cameras/CANON/229">CANON PowerShot G2</a></td></tr><tr><th>Exposure time:</th><td>1/50s</td></tr><tr><th>Aperture:</th><td>f/3.5</td></tr><tr><th>Focal Length:</th><td>21mm</td></tr></table></div>
