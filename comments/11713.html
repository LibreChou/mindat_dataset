<div class="photocomments">Wurtzite crystal with distinctive hemimorphic, trigonal symmetry. Blunt ends on such crystals usually show phantoms. This 2-mm crystal is associated with minor sphalerite and sits in a crack in a siderite concretion. Calcite formerly filled the  crack and has been etched out with dilute HCl.
