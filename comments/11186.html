<div class="photocomments">11.5x 7.5x 7 cm. A very rich matrix lapis, the largest crystal, shown in the close up is 1.8 cm across.  There is also a slightly larger crystal, with a band of pyrite through it. Most lapis crystals are usually found as single crystals in marble, but this piece has a display face entirely covered with them.<br/><br/>This photo has been shown 876 times<table class="picshowextradata"><tr><th>Dimensions:</th><td>640x480px (0.31 megapixels)</td></tr><tr><th>Date/Time of Photo:</th><td>16th Mar 2003 09:35:58</td></tr><tr><th>Camera:</th><td><a href="/cameras/CANON/229">CANON PowerShot G2</a></td></tr><tr><th>Exposure time:</th><td>1/8s</td></tr><tr><th>Aperture:</th><td>f/2.5</td></tr><tr><th>Focal Length:</th><td>21mm</td></tr></table></div>
