<div class="photocomments">Two curved kyanite crystals from Kadunguri Whiteschists, Zambezi Belt, Zimbabwe.  I have seen over 20 kilos of this stuff and another few hundred are on the way.  Great gemmy material, not as dark as the Indian stuff.  Polishes well.  Not too many of them exhibit the bent crystal shape.  Less than 5% of the ones I have seen so far.  Biggest crystal is 5.7 x 1.3 x .6 cm<br/><br/>This photo has been shown 835 times<table class="picshowextradata"><tr><th>Dimensions:</th><td>432x324px (0.14 megapixels)</td></tr></table></div>
